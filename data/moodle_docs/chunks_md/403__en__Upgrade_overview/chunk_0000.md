# Upgrade overview

_Moodle 4.3 available now!_ Start enjoying the cool features of the latest and greatest version of Moodle in four easy steps...
## Step 1: Make sure that your server can run Moodle 4.3
(Note: You need to upgrade to Moodle 3.11.8 or later before upgrading to 4.3.)
Go to _Site administration > Server > Environment_
Status OK for everything? Great! Go to step 2...
Any problems? You probably need to upgrade your server software (such as PHP) to a more recent version.
## Step 2: Be prepared!
As usual with any large upgrade, you should always be prepared to "roll back" if there's an issue with your data or some custom code you've added.

A test install
    We highly advise you make a copy of your production site to practice the upgrade on first. That way, if you run into any problems that need fixing you won't affect your main site.
