Always make backups
    When upgrading your production instance, make sure you have copies of everything, just in case. Full instructions are here: Site backup.
## Step 3: Replace your Moodle code
At this point you can replace the Moodle code on your server with the version you downloaded.

Check plugins
    Any plugins you have installed will also to be replaced with a version for your new Moodle version. If there is not yet an updated version of the plugin available, it will need to be uninstalled before upgrading your site.
## Step 4: Perform the upgrade!
Trigger the upgrade by visiting the admin page.
If you have a large site this may take hours, so we recommend upgrading via command line.
## How did you go?

Yes - it worked!
    Great! Repeat the process for Moodle 4.3, and please post in the Installation help forum and share your success with the Moodle community!
